
# Node js playground. 

This is to test and playaround with all featues and functionalities. Read the instructions before starting and changelogs to see changes

# Features 

- MVC structure
- 2 types of encryption & decryption middleware. one is of AES and another one 
- response middleware to make the response sending structure same for all api point.
- oAuth 2.0 available
- error handling middleware with enum HTTP error codes
- monitor app by visiting url: /status
- a colorful console log function


### Encryption type:
- **OPTION 1** The encryption algorithm used here is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) which is a symmetric encryption algorithm. It is a widely used encryption standard and considered to be secure.
- **OPTION 2** This code is using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for encryption and decryption. Specifically, it is using AES with a 256-bit key size in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with PKCS7 padding. The encryption key is generated by hashing a secret key string using the SHA256 algorithm.
